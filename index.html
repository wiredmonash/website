<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<img id="homeImg" src="assets/images/3dPrint.jpg" alt="WIRED" width="400" height="225" />
<p>We are the official Faculty of IT student society at Monash University, Clayton. If you're not a member
	yet,
	<a href="https://wired.org.au/join">come and join us!</a></p>
<p>We aim to provide a relaxed, social atmosphere where students can meet others who share their love for
	everything
	digital. Our community is one where we can share our opinions on the latest technology, and collaborate
	on
	projects and competitions.</p>
<p>We also provide our members the opportunity to connect with some of Australia's leading technology
	companies
	through our many sponsored lunchtime events and networking opportunities - such as our Industry Night.
</p>
<p>Past events that we have held include our Annual Trivia Night, Midnight-to-Dawn Laser Tag, and the hugely
	successful UNIHACK Melbourne hackathon competition. We also hold workshops to allow students to expand
	their
	knowledge such as data visualisation and cyber security.</p>
<p>Our club is a registered academic club with Monash Clubs and Societies.</p>
